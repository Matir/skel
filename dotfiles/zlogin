# This file is sourced only for login shells (e.g., SSH sessions, initial TTY logins).
# For most interactive shells on macOS (like those in Terminal.app or iTerm2), it is NOT sourced.
# All active Zsh startup and completion logic has been moved to .zshrc and .zshenv for better consistency and performance.
