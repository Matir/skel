## Installation

This is a set of dotfiles and utilities for setting up my personal environment
on POSIX-style environments. It is cloned from github and installed from the
`install.sh` script.

It mostly relies on symlinking dotfiles and other resources into the appropriate
locations, bnut also installs dependencies in various ways.
